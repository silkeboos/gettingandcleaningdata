# Getting an Cleaning Data - Course Project
The goal of this project is to prepare a tidy dataset of an analysis of accelerometer data, which was collected by an experiment with a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

### Contents

- `README.md` - This file, which explains how the script works
- `Codebook.md` - Description of the variables and data and the steps of summarizing the data
- `run_analysis.R` - R script to merge, clean up, filter and summarize the experiment data
- `tidy.txt` - Output file of the run_analysis.R script

### Execution plan

1. Read the CodeBook.md file and the run_analysis.R script to get a general understanding of the project and the steps which where undertaken to generate the final dataset `tidy.txt`.
2. Make sure that the raw data of the experiment (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) are downloaded and extracted to the project directory which is called `UCI HAR Dataset`.
3. Run the `run_analysis.R` script.
